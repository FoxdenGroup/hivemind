            "Threat hunting is an active and proactive approach to 
            cybersecurity that involves actively searching for threats or 
            indicators of compromise within an organization's network or systems. 
            It goes beyond traditional security measures, such as antivirus software 
            and firewalls, by actively seeking out potential threats that may have evaded 
            detection.","The goal of threat hunting is to identify and mitigate threats before 
            they cause significant damage or result in a data breach. 
            It involves the use of various tools, techniques, and data analysis methods 
            to uncover abnormal or suspicious 
            activities that may indicate the presence of an attacker or unauthorized access."

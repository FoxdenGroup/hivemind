"Electronic Code Block mode a.k.a ECB is one of the simplest modes of operations in block ciphers suitable for small number of blocks. In ECB, message is divided into blocks and each block is encrypted independently. A single key is used to encrypt every block and if a plaintext block appears more than once in a message sop does the encrypted block. It is worth nothing that ECB is vulnerable to cut paste attacks."

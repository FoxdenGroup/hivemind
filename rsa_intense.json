"RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a widely used asymmetric encryption algorithm in cryptography. It is named after its inventors, Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman. RSA is based on the mathematical properties of large prime numbers and commonly used for secure data transmission, digital signatures, and key exchange. It involves the use of a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The security of RSA lies in the fact that it is computationally difficult to factorize large composite numbers into their prime factors. The larger the key size used in RSA, the stronger the encryption."

"RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is an asymmetric encryption algorithm that operates based on the mathematical properties of large prime numbers. Here are steps involved in RSA: 
I. Key Generation:
	1. Select two primes P and Q such that P is not equals to Q.
	2. Calculate N = P * Q
	3. Calculate phi(N) = (P-1) * (Q-1)
	4. Select integer E, where GCD of phi(N) = 1 and 1 < e < phi(N)
	5. Calculate D, where D = E^-1 * mod(phi(N))
	6. Public key = [E,N]
	7. Private key = [D,N]
	
II. Encryption:
	1. Plaintext (M), where M < N
	2. Ciphertext (C), where C =  M^E * mod(N)
	
III. Decryption: 
	1. Ciphertext (C)
	2. Plaintext (M), where M = C^D * mod(N)
	
Example of RSA Algorithm: 
	Let P = 11 & Q = 13
	N = P * Q = 143
	phi(N) = (P-1) * (Q-1) = 120
	Let E = 23
	D = E^-1 * mod(phi(N)) = 47
	
	Let plaintext (M) be 7
	Then ciphertext (C) = M^E * mod(N) = 2"

## ðŸš€ About Hivemind

Hivemind is the centralized repository for training data behind the Echo-AI which is an AI assistant developed using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and the Keras library. It recognizes user input via voice or text, and generates appropriate responses using a deep learning model. The program is easily configurable and loaded with data in JSON format.

In addition to recognizing and responding to user input, Echo-AI can be hard-coded to perform specific tasks such as checking for a wellness value or responding to pre-defined messages. This means that it can be used in conjunction with smart automated programming to maintain the host system on behalf of the operator.

Echo-AI comes with pre-built generic responses and code to help kickstart your journey into AI. It is also pre-trained, making it easy to get started with minimal effort.
